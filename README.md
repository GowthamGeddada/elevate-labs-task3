Overview

This task involves analyzing the Superstore dataset using Tableau Desktop to uncover insights about sales, profit, and customer behavior. I designed interactive dashboards that visualize key business metrics, helping to identify performance trends and improvement opportunities.

My work:

1.Data Understanding & Preparation:

Explored the Superstore dataset to understand the structure and available fields (Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity, Category, Region, etc.).

Checked for missing or inconsistent data before creating visualizations.

Selected important measures and dimensions to focus the analysis on sales performance and profitability.

2.Data Visualization in Tableau:

Imported the dataset into Tableau Desktop and created multiple worksheets for different perspectives.

Built charts such as:

Sales and Profit by Region

Category and Sub-Category Performance

Monthly Sales Trend

Top Customers by Sales

Profit vs Discount Analysis

3.Dashboard Design:

Combined all visualizations into an interactive dashboard.

Added filters for Region, Category, and Year to allow users to explore the data dynamically.

Used KPIs, color coding, and tooltips to make insights clear and visually appealing.

Ensured the dashboard was well-organized and easy to interpret for decision-makers.

4.Insights Discovered:

The West Region generates the highest sales and profit overall.

Technology and Office Supplies are the most profitable categories.

High discounts reduce profit significantly in some sub-categories.

Sales typically peak during the fourth quarter each year.

Dataset Used:

Superstore Dataset — Provided by Tableau for practice and analysis

Outcome:

The final Tableau dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of Superstore’s business performance. It allows users to:

Monitor sales and profit trends

Compare product categories and regions

Identify problem areas and profitable segments

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze data, build visual stories, and design interactive dashboards for data-driven decision-making.
